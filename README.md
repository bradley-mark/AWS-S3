Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) can host static websites without a need for a web server. 

In this solution, there are no Windows or Linux servers to manage, and no need to provision machines, install operating systems, or fine-tune web server configurations. Thereâ€™s also no need to manage storage infrastructure (such as, SAN, NAS) because Amazon S3 provides practically limitless cloud-based storage. Fewer moving parts means fewer troubleshooting headaches.

# Scalability and availability

Amazon S3 is inherently scalable. For popular websites, Amazon S3 scales seamlessly to serve thousands of HTTP or HTTPS requests per second without any changes to the architecture.

In addition, by hosting with Amazon S3, the website is inherently highly available. Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% durability, and carries a service level agreement (SLA) of 99.9% availability.
