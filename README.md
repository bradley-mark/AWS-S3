Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) can host static websites without a need for a web server. 

In this solution, there are no Windows or Linux servers to manage, and no need to provision machines, install operating systems, or fine-tune web server configurations. Thereâ€™s also no need to manage storage infrastructure (such as, SAN, NAS) because Amazon S3 provides practically limitless cloud-based storage. Fewer moving parts means fewer troubleshooting headaches.
